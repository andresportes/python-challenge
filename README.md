# python-challenge
In this assignment, I used the concepts I learned at my Data Analytics Bootcamp through Columbia Universityto complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks presented a real-world situation where my newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.
I did use various sources to help with this challlenge. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56640207/how-to-add-the-date-in-a-for-loop-without-if-else-statements, for trouble with looping. 
As well as google searches for exporting results to a text file.
